/*  Arg_parser reads the arguments in 'argv' and creates a number of
    option codes, option arguments and non-option arguments.

    In case of error, 'ap_error' returns a non-null pointer to an error
    message.

    'options' is an array of 'struct ap_Option' terminated by an element
    containing a code which is zero. A null name means a short-only
    option. A code value outside the unsigned char range means a
    long-only option.

    Arg_parser normally makes it appear as if all the option arguments
    were specified before all the non-option arguments for the purposes
    of parsing, even if the user of your program intermixed option and
    non-option arguments. If you want the arguments in the exact order
    the user typed them, call 'ap_init' with 'in_order' = true.

    The argument '--' terminates all options; any following arguments are
    treated as non-option arguments, even if they begin with a hyphen.

    The syntax for optional option arguments is '-<short_option><argument>'
    (without whitespace), or '--<long_option>=<argument>'.
