                             Compiling flowgrind
                             ===================

Dependencies
============

Flowgrind depends on the following tools and libraries:
- GNU build tools 
- libxmlrpc-c with curl transport and abyss server 

These libraries as well as their headers and tools need to be installed
(install appropriate -dev packages too).

The following dependencies are optional and only required for advanced features:
- libpcap (for automatic dump, optional)
- libgsl (for advanced traffic generation, optional)

Building flowgrind
==================

1. a) Extract source tarball OR
   b) Checkout flowgrind from the git repository
      (e.g. git clone git://github.com/flowgrind/flowgrind.git)

2. cd into the flowgrind directory

3. Only if using a copy from the git repository run
     autoreconf -i

4. Run  ./configure  to build the makefiles. If this step fails, you are
   missing a working compiler toolchain or some dependencies. Analyze the
   output of configure for more information.
   Read  ./configure --help  for a list of supported options.

   e.g. disable libgsl and libpcap with: --disable-gsl --disable-pcap

5. Run make to compile flowgrind. This creates src/flowgrind and src/flowgrindd

6. Optionally run (sudo) make install to copy the binaries to the installation prefix.
